## I hate

My name is Carlos Arguello, Nicaraguan, geek, 16, laptop running Manjaro XFCE, which is my suitable DE, for some shitty reason KDE doesn't work and I don't want to spare fucking time trying to make work when I got this one out of the box.

For those interested this is how my desktop looks like ![XFCE DE looks like]({{ http://i.imgur.com/RnbpvdT.png }}/images/Manjaro DE.png  "Manjaro for those who do") Manjaro for those who do bitch!


So i'm running _Jekyll_ with github pages and hosting my code directly, which is something nice, and TBH I neved tried this before, but as I can see it works, as it should.

So I'm 16, I am a student, I'm a geek, my lifes resumes pretty easily to Computers, Programming, reading about cool stuff people don't read mainly beacuse they do not understand and do no stand **_English_** and seriously, _it's no my fucking problem_ get yourself a book and start learning. 

### Cleaning my mind

This past weeks I have been really out of myself, there is a girl whose I know, her name kinda be _Biggest bitch I've known_ ok then, that's really gross but what the hell, I hate and haters gotta hate too babe...

I'll reach the end later once I update fucking CCleaner and refresh my mind, until...
